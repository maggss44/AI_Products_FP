      "Query:  How to keep indoor plants healthy\n",
      "Answer: To keep indoor plants healthy, here are some tips you can follow:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Light**: Make sure your plants are placed in an area where they receive adequate sunlight according to their specific light requirements. If natural light is limited, consider using artificial grow lights.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Watering**: Be mindful not to overwater or underwater your plants. Allow the soil to dry out slightly between waterings, and always check the plant's specific watering needs.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Humidity**: Indoor environments can have low humidity, which may not be ideal for some plants. Increase humidity by misting your plants, using a humidifier, or placing a tray of water near them.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Temperature**: Most indoor plants thrive in temperatures between 65-75 degrees Fahrenheit. Avoid placing them near drafty windows, heating or cooling vents.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Fertilization**: Use a balanced fertilizer to provide essential nutrients to your plants during their growing season. Follow the instructions on the fertilizer packaging for best results.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. **Pruning**: Regularly prune dead or yellowing leaves, as well as trim back overgrown branches to encourage healthy growth.\n",
      "\n",
      "7. **Pest Control**: Keep an eye out for common pests like spider mites, fungus gnats, and mealybugs. Treat any infestations promptly using natural or chemical pest control methods.\n",
      "\n",
      "8. **Repotting**: As your plants grow, repot them into slightly larger containers with fresh potting soil. This ensures they have enough space for root growth.\n",
      "\n",
      "9. **Cleaning**: Dust your plant's leaves regularly to allow them to absorb more sunlight and prevent pests from hiding in the foliage.\n",
      "\n",
      "By following these general guidelines and being attentive to the specific needs of your individual plants, you can help ensure they stay healthy and thrive in your indoor space.\n",
